[2. (INDU) INTRODUCTION & QUESTIONS]

- What IS this thing?
    It's a language REPLACEMENT pack for Lore v6.0.

- What is "Lore"?  What does it do?
    Lore is / was a language AddOn for World of Warcraft v1.12 and higher.
It allowed players to speak in a variety of custom (and unused) languages,
as well as chat in languages with other players who also had the AddOn.
  
    It was ultimately abandoned in v4.0.0 (Cataclysm) and superceded by the
superior language AddOn, "Tongues", by Skrull and many others.

    You can find more information and downloads here:
    https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/lore

- Why did you make a language pack for a dead addon?
    Two words: "emulated server".

    Basically, I play on an unofficial World of Warcraft v1.12 server and just
wanted more language to play around with.  I then went a little overboard and
decided to just add all the official World of Warcraft Retail languages that
existed.  Oops.

- You're missing one: "Complex Cipher"
    That's noted in the "WoWv9-dialects.lua" file, itself.
    But simply put: I couldn't get it to work with Lore.  Sorry.

- There's an ugly hyphen in the languages list that doesn't do anything.
    That's ALSO noted in the "WoWv9-dialects.lua" file, itself.
    But really, it's just there to keep things tidy.

- What the heck is "Orkish" and "Forsaken" and such?
    That's also-ALSO noted in the "WoWv9-dialects.lua" file, itself.
    But, okay.  Lore doesn't like having players talk in languages they
"shouldn't know", such as humans knowing Orcish or gnomes knowing Troll.
So... pseudonyms were used for those who REALLY want those languages.
   (I tried modifying Lore, itself, but I'm too dumb in LUA to make it happen.)
   Additionally, later versions of WoW actually DID rename some languages,
such as "Troll" to "Zandali" and "Gutterspeak" to "Forsaken".  So, yeah~

- Why is this called a "replacement" pack?  Don't you normally ADD languages?
    I'm reading this as a "dialects.lua" replacement file because I've updated
some of the existing languages from the official "Dialects V8" file.
You DO NOT NEED to have a "dialects.lua" file in your Lore installation.
This file will OVERRIDE that one.

- Where are the FUN languages like "Dark Iron" and "Nerubian"?
    I removed them. (Don't yell at me, plz. ,^,)
    I removed them because there was no official source for these languages
that I could find.  You're absolutely welcome to add them back in, though!
Just follow the instructions provided with the V8 Dialects file~

[4. (HOTO) HOW TO USE]

  Things You'll Need
  - Lore v6.0 for World of Warcraft v1.12
   (Again, that's at https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/lore.)
  - The ability to rename files.

  How to Add This to Lore, The Simple Way
  - EXTRACT the JDC_WoWv9-dialects.lua somewhere.
  - RENAME "JDC_WoWv9-dialects.lua" to "dialects.lua".
  - COPY (or MOVE) the newly-renamed dialects.lua into your
    World of Warcraft "Interface\AddOns\Lore" directory.
  - You're good to go~

[5. (SPTH) SPECIAL THANKS]

  - Rook, Liise (no websites available?)
    Rook, firstly, for MAKING Lore in the first place and Liise, secondly, for
    updating it until there was no need.

  - Skrull (N/A), AuroraBlade (https://www.curseforge.com/members/aurorablade)
    Skurll, for making the superbly-superb update to Lore called "Tongues",
    and AuroraBlade, for keeping the darn thing updated and adding languages.

  - Blizzard Entertainment (http://blizzard.com/)
    I meeaaan... they DID make World of Warcraft...  And they didn't HAVE to
    make it so easy to have AddOns and stuff...  So, THANKS, Old Guard~!

  - The Turtle WoW Staff and Community (https://turtle-wow.org)
    You dirty dogs got me back into World of Warcraft after, like, six years.
    (Yeah, I was a no-name Nost player.)  The game is great and the community
    is super-friendly.  I definitely recommend checking it out if WoW Classic
    just isn't doin' it for ya.  It's all very Blizz-like but with... SOME...
    new stuff, here and there~
