[WHAT IS THIS THINGY?]
Why, it's a brand new dialect file for the awesome chat addon, Tongues!

[WHAT DOES IT DO?]
Quite simply, it replaces any and all normal swear words, such as "@#&!" or
"&@#!$%@&" into something of similar nature, but much less offensive.

[SO IT'S A CHAT FILTER?]
Basically!

[DOESN'T WOW ALREADY HAVE ONE OF THOSE?]
Yes, but it's boring.  This is MUCH more interesting! (And much more fun!)

[WHAT ARE "OXHORN BRAND SWEARS"?]
Oxhorn Brand Movies is the brainchild of Brandon M. Dennis, aka "Oxhorn".
It's basically a series of movies and stories about his and his friends'
characters in World of Warcraft.  It's mostly comedic stuff, but there's some
drama as well as lots of action!  Check it out on YouTube or at Oxhorn.com!

[THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHAT "OXHORN BRAND SWEARS" ARE!]
Oh right...  Well, the idea of these particular "alternate swears" come from
the "Inventing Swear Words" series, wherein the three main characters go on a
quest to bypass the swear filter.  To do so, they simply make up their own set
of swear words listed here:

blit: noun (contemptable person; unpleasant stuff; anything)
bloit: verb (gripe; mess up; act careless)
       phrasal verb (shirk; impatience; waste time)
       interjection (anger)
       adjective/adverb (confounded)
chak: verb (act carelessly)
flak: noun (anything; to care)
      verb (undesireable position)
grat: interjection (focused anger/disgust)
      adjective/adverb (confounded)
wolsh: verb (act carelessly; abuse)
       noun (anything)

(All words defined as seen in Oxhorn Brand Movies and explained in detail here:

[WHY ISN'T THIS A LANGUAGE FILE OR A FILTER?]
- If I'd made it a LANGUAGE file, your character would either be speaking
  otherwise normal Common/Orcish tagged with [Oxhorn] behind it, or worse, they
  might not be able to speak at all! (Due to how Language files work.  I
  haven't actually tested this one though, so I might be wrong.)
- I COULD make it a FILTER file, but that would require disabling WoW's own
  chat filter, first.  It would work quite well if you did that, but not
  everyone remembers to do so.  Plus, I'm not entirely sure your OWN words
  would be auto-filtered like they are with DIALECT files. (This will require
  some testing.)

[ALRIGHT, I'LL TRY IT.  HOW DO I INSTALL THIS PUPPY?]
1. Open dia_OxhornBrand.txt.
2. Copy the contents into your Tongues custom dialect file.
2a. It's advised you create a new file called "customdialects.lua" instead
    of plunking it into the normal TXT file.  Every new version of Tongues
    comes with a new version of all the TXT files found in Tongues\Custom.
3. In World of Warcraft, open up the Tongues menu and select either 
   either "Oxhorn Brand (Relaxed)" or "Oxhorn Brand (Strict)" as your dialect.
4. Just you bloitting try and swear NOW, you flakking little wolsh.

[WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "RELAXED" AND "STRICT" SETTINGS?]
- "Relaxed" settings censor/replace all words the WoW chat filter would pick
  up.  This usually includes all the most vulgar and hostile words out there.
- "Strict" settings censor other words that the WoW filter doesn't normally
  pick up, but could be deemed offensive, such as "Hell" or "damn".

[WHY ISN'T "BASTARD SWORD" CENSORED?]
Because that's not a swear word when used in that context!  I actually went
out of my way to make sure that one didn't get censored, but only if the word
"sword" immediately followed "bastard".  Otherwise, it gets filtered!
(Strict settings only.)

[I'D LIKE TO GET IN CONTACT WITH YOU SOMEHOW]
If you liked or didn't like the filter, want to recommend changes, or just
want to say something, feel free to hit me up on Twitter or Tumblr.  I'm not
too hard to find, considering my name on both is "doclithius"!

[WILL WE SEE MORE UPDATES?]
Probably.  Goodness knows, I don't know EVERY English vulgarity out there.
