## What is Lore?
Lore is designed to aid Roleplayers in World of Warcraft with the ability to
speak in 'languages' other than those enabled by Blizzard. Lore contains a set
of custom languages and you can make your own languages if you wish. So, if you
want your character to be able to speak in Demonic, Elemental, or some other
exotic language like Nerubian, Lore can help you there.

This version of Lore also supports the use of dialects and you can define how
well you master a certain language.

Further details and instructions can be found in the AddOn's [`ReadMe.txt`](https://github.com/JoLiKMC/Lore/blob/main/ReadMe.txt) file.
